# RaceLineTV - Alexa Skill

This is an Alexa skill that provides a starting point for creating a skill that uses the [VideoApp Interface](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/videoapp-interface-reference.html) to stream native video files. 
To see this skill in action, you can enable a live example by saying `Alexa, enable RaceLine TV` and then `Alexa, open RaceLine TV`.

# Enjoy !
